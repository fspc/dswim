# Read QUICKSTART for a quick start, and check out the SWIMZ.LIST 
# section in swim(8) for much more information.  This list is read 
# sequentially, so earlier entries are read before later entries 
# 
# Debian users: Unlike apt which only downloads Packages, swim reads this
# list based on the specified or default distribution/architecture to
# make handling the downloading of both the Contents and Packages files
# easier.  Look at the Cron example in /usr/doc/swim/examples.
