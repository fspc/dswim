0.4.3 - 01/05/2005
------------------

Stricter checking in Perl 5.8 caused the db not to be built if
fastswim noticed non-existent files because this is considered a fatal
error.  Removed the die function and now check for non-existent files
in fastswim, imswim also produced some related error output that was
fixed.


0.4.2 - 11/06/2002
------------------

Fixes error output caused by repetitive opts found by the recent Getopt::Long.
Rebuild db if you've updated to the newest DB_File.


0.4.1 - 10/24/2001
------------------
	
Adds the --enhances option for binary dependencies.

0.4.0 - 10/23/2001
------------------	

 Dswim now creates databases for non-root users.  All db are now created in
$HOME/default_directory/var/lib/dpkg rather than /var/lib/dpkg, and 
.swim_history is put here, too.

Separated the documentation into a separate package, but keep man pages 
around for backwards and current compatibility, and wrote a warning at top.

Removed lots of the -n db options from help because they are broken in 
relation to major changes in the Debian archive.  Left some just as 
reminders of dswims inherent ability for older Debian archives.

Updated copylet and swim is now DSWIM .. Debian System Wide Information 
Manager.  Changed "Package administration and research tool for Debian" to 
DSWIM.

Changed --nz to --no-download and now works properly with simulate.

--rebuilddb automatically when noticing a change near the beginning of 
command() after --db --check runs  Added $no_rebuilddb configuration option 
to allow users to override this behavior.

--remove and --purge are now handled by apt-get and apt's new --reinstall 
added.

--source (-b, --diff-only, --tar-only) and --build-deb are new options to
replace the old --ftp options because all this stuff is now handled by
apt-get.

Added --config and --templates to the query options.

--initdb and --rebuilddb STDOUT output are now STDERR mostly to make debconf
happy, and both of these options return their corresponding names via their
functions.

Fixed many of the defined bugs and a few of the regexp bugs ..
these were just the complaints of the newer Perl.

Fixed undef values when scripts() was called more than once when used with
-qf, --scripts, -d|-l and -T.

Added swim_pkg to CVS to simplify packaging dswim.

The control dependencies have been improved.

0.3.6 - 10/20/2000
------------------
	
Made swim perl-5.6 happy.  Thanks to Douglas du Boulay
<ddb@crystal.uwa.edu.au> for pointing this out.

0.3.5 -  01/28/2000
-------------------

Fixed a minor bug pertaining to the mtime of Contents which occured
during initial building of the uninstalled filesystem using FDBDF or
DF.  This bug arose as a result of a bug fix in 0.3.4.

0.3.4 - 01/23/2000
------------------

Made the changelog and copyright option work properly in relation to
the fsstnd Debian has adopted with backwards compatibility.  Fixed a
regexp in Qftp to properly deal with packages which match one another,
but aren't the same.  Fixed xyzr to work properly with ps.  Fixed share
-d/l output for p option.  Added an indication when extraction
succeeds.  Now Contents is properly filtered for ndb. Removed extra
output from menu for package option.  Added example documentation,
thanks to John Lapeyre for the suggestion.  Also, thanks to Joel Soete
for reporting corrupt sources from a faulty upload, and to tucows.com
for adding swim to their archive and awarding swim 5 Penguins.

0.3.3 - 01/15/2000
------------------

Repaired a bug in longswim causing the uninstalled filesystem to be
made with packages which looked like spaces due to a return code error,
which caused some trouble for the virtual directories.  ncontents is
now filtered of ./, though it was cool to look at.

0.3.2 - 01/05/2000
------------------

Fixed to properly find documentation in the not-installed new Debian
share directories, perl5 in Depends for the new Debian perl policy, and
year 2000 in help.

0.3.1 - 01/04/2000
------------------

Because of change in Debian's directory structure in Contents, added a
filter so that not-installed database is properly made without repeats.
Fixed a documentation error in QUICKSTART.  Made swim@the.netpedia.net
default anonymous login.  Minor documentation improvements. 

0.3.0 - 06/15/1999
------------------

Many significant bug fixes, users of earlier releases should rebuild
their databases.  Additional useful features including a history and
