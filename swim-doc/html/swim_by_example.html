We run a search for case-insensitive matches for the word "quake."
Because we don't know how many matches the search will find, the
descriptions of all packages found are supressed with "--no."  Note: "-n"
pertains to the not-installed (uninstalled) distribution.  

<pre>
linuxalive:/home/swim/SWIMANIA$ swim -n --search quake/i --no
swim: found 17 package(s)

After looking at the descriptions for the packages found through the "quake" search we decide
to narrow down the search to "tools."  Notes:  We could have done this for any part of the
history by specifying a number.  "--research" will not write the changes to the history,
"--refinesearch"  will write the changes to the history.  The qstat package is installed, but 
there is a newer version.

Description: GTK program for manipulating pak archives
 gtkpak is a nifty GTK tool for manipulating the pak archives used by Quake,
 Quake 2, and QuakeWorld.  It can view, extract, create, and append pak
 archives.  pak contains basic command-line utilities that can do much of
 what gtkpak does without X or GTK, but gtkpak is easier to work with by
 far.  Installing both won't hurt anything.

Description: command-line tools for pak archives
 This package contains pakx and pakc, a couple of tools for working with the
 pak archives used by Quake, Quake 2, and QuakeWorld.  pakc can create and
 add files to archives, pakx can list and extract files from them.  gtkpak
 is a bit fancier but then again it requires X and GTK.

Oh no, xqf is going to be removed!  Let's make sure that this isn't a

package is included in the unstable distribution, let's find out what's
going on here! 

<pre>

Reading Package Lists...
Building Dependency Tree...
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.

Since you only requested a single operation it is extremely likely that
the package is simply not installable and a bug report against
that package should be filed.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

Sorry, but the following packages have unmet dependencies:
  xqf: Conflicts: qstat (< 2.1z-2.1a-0.1) but 2.0b-1 is to be installed
E: Sorry, broken packages
linuxalive:/home/swim/SWIMANIA$ swim -qnT qstat
qstat_2.3e-1
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.1.2)
Conflicts: xqf (<< 0.9.2-1)
</pre>

<p> As seen above, the reason why xqf has to be removed is due to a
dependency in qstat which the packager (Michael Alan Dorman
&lt;mdorman@debian.org&gt;) will have to resolve by uploading a newer version of
xqf to the distribution.  Sometimes necessary packages are still in
Debian's Incoming directory at the ftp site, and not in the distribution,
so we may want to check there first.  If this isn't the case we will send
a bug report to Debian's Bug Tracking System pointing out that there needs
to be a newer version of xqf.  In the meantime we have decided that we
only want gtkpak and pak.  We will use swim's editing capabilities to take
gstat off the list.  Notes:  Another possibility for the bug shown above
is that apt's cache needs to be updated to reflect the changes in Debain's
distribution by using "swim --apt --update."  When the history is edited
with "--stdin"  the history makes a new entry reflecting the change.  The
full history is accessible from "--stdin."  Anybody can send a bug to
Debian's Bug Tracking System.

If we don't have apt we can still download these packages, and their sources.  Here is another
way to do the same thing we did above without using apt.  Notes:  This time we saved some
typing by doing "--stdin" with "--research."  We specified "--source" with "--ftp"  to get the
sources as well as the packages, or we could have just gotten the sources by themselves by
specifying "--source_only" with "--ftp."  Changes made while in "--stdin" are written to the
history.

<p>
We notice that the sources only had to be downloaded once.  Looking at the packages'
information we notice both packages share the same sources as indicated in the "Source" field. 
The field is absent for the pak package because the source name is exactly the same as the
package's name, but for the gtkpak package this isn't the case, so the "Source" field is
present.

<p>
We can find the packages and the sources in their proper location on our local archive mirror.

0. Intro

gtkpak is a PAK file viewer for Gtk+. What are PAK files? A PAK file is used
in id software games such as Quake and Quake 2, and their spin-offs. Just
imagine collapsing an entire directory scheme into a big wad of files, and
there you have a PAK file.

The three binaries are built around the interface provided in pakfile.h,
which is a C++ class that allows access to the contents of a PAKFile, including
searching and extracting from an already existing PAK file, to add files and
then writing a new PAK file. The three binaries are then just front-ends
to this functionality, in one way or another.

While it's tempting to make the classes provided in pakfile.h into a shared
library, it's probably unnecessary. But it does make one tingly, eh?

And all this is GPL'ed, of course. See the file COPYING for license details.

We can check to see if the uninstalled distribution had any changes.  Notes: The results below
indicate the changes found in the new Package databases that have been downloaded by updating
apt; if we don't have apt then swim's major mode "--ftp" can be used with "DF."  With "--ndb" 
use APT to indicate apt sources, or DF to indicate Package databases gotten directly through
swim's "--ftp".  If we originally made the uninstalled distribution with an uninstalled
filesystem by using "--Contents DF" then to update the uninstalled distribution "--Contents
DF" should be used again; this isn't necessary when running a check.  To rebuild
(--rebuildndb), update (--ndb), or check a distribution other than the default one, use
"--dists stable", "--dists frozen" or "--dists unstable."  The newest Packages can
automatically be picked by using "--cron."

<p>
A little blurb:  Although not Debian approved or sanctioned, we find the unstable distribution
acceptably stable in relation to certain well-known commercial distributions despite
infrequent packaging bugs like the one shown in the xqf example above.  The Debian
distribution adheres to a self-imposed level of quality found in no other distribution in the
world.  Usually, unstable undergoes many changes so there isn't a time advantage over updating
DF versus rebuilding DF, but this process is easier on system resources.  On the other hand,
updating FDBDF (no uninstalled filesystem) is faster.

Description: A PostScript and PDF viewer for X using 3d Athena Widgets
 `gv' is a comfortable viewer of PostScript and PDF files for the X
 Window System.
 .
 It uses the `ghostscript' PostScript(tm) interpreter and is based
 on the classic X front-end for `gs', `ghostview'. It is more
 comfortable and more powerful than `ghostview'.
 .
 Some features as e.g. PDF files or anti-aliasing are only supported
 if a recent ghostscript (4.0 or later) is installed.  With
 anti-aliasing turned on, the text is very crisp and readable, with no
 `stepping' on the slants at all.

While we were in this directory we decided to do a little research.  It is interesting to note
that for the installed system there are 14 files which don't belong to any packages. There
could be a variety of reasons for this (maybe we are slobs); this is good stuff to know. 
Notes:  To see the total list just add "-t" to the existing command-line options.  There is a
big difference in using "." and "*",  "." is the same as saying "./" but it only lists the
same package once, whereas "*" would look at all the files in the immediate directory and if
two files belong to the same package, that package will be shown twice for each file, it also
reports if a file doesn't belong to a package.

We notice a file in the lib directory, and we wonder what it belongs to.

<pre>
linuxalive:/lib$ swim -qf libthread_db-1.0.so --shlibs
libc6_2.1.2-11
Shlibs:
ld-linux 2 libc6 (>= 2.1.2)
libBrokenLocale 1 libc6 (>= 2.1.2)
.. everything not shown ..
libthread_db 1 libc6 (>= 2.1.2)
libutil 1 libc6 (>= 2.1.2)

<p>
We want to find out what dependencies apt has.

<pre>
linuxalive:/lib$ swim -qfnT /usr/bin/apt-get

We need a header file called w32skrnl.h.  We are in luck it's already on our system.  Notes: 
We could have done "locate w32skrnl.h" and then done a "swim -qf", but we haven't updated our
locatedb in months.  The package installation will be tested by apt if it exists. 

<pre>

Sometimes it is nice to know the total of what we have installed.

<pre>
linuxalive:/usr/X11R6/bin$ swim -qa
use --total or -t to see all 1449 packages
linuxalive:/usr/X11R6/bin$ swim -qf /

We can check the MD5 checksum for all the configuation files on the system.  Notes:  MD5
checksum can be performed on "-l", "-d", "-c", or "-p."   This can only be performed on the
installed system.

We happen to be hamradio enthusiasts.  Let's see what packages exist in the hamradio group.

<pre>
linuxalive:/usr/lib/perl5/SWIM$ swim -qng hamradio
acfax_981011-3
ax25-apps_0.0.4-1
ax25-tools_0.0.5-1
colrconv_0.99.2-4
dgipip_0.1-2
gc_1.07-3
hamsoft_0.1.1-1
"rest of the output not shown"
</pre>

<p>
We edit the hamradio group package list with "--stdin."  Notes: "--stdin" needs to be
called with either "--ftp", "-x", "-xyz", "-xz", "--purge", "-r", or "--remove" to work. This
is a readline interface.  If we are in emacs mode (see man bash) here are some commands we can
use to make the process easier. 

<p>
Note: The key bindings may be different on your system.
<br>Ctrl-a  =   move to the beginning of the line
<br>Ctrl-e  =   move to the end of the line
<br>Ctrl-w  =   erase (kill) one word backward
<br>Esc-d   =   kill one word forward
<br>Esc-b   =   move one word backward 
<br>Esc-f   =   move one word forward 
<br>Ctrl-k  =   kill forward to the end of the line 
<br>Ctrl-y  =   retrieve (yank) last item killed
<br>Ctrl-r  =   search backward
<br>Esc-&lt;   =   move to the beginning of the history

We are finding new ways to swim everyday;  we often solve problems in minutes which used
to take an hour or more to solve. If you find a novel use for swim, please tell us, and we
will add it to these examples.
