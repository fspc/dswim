    <chapt id="description">DESCRIPTION

<p>

<prgn>swimrc</prgn> is the configuartion file for swim allowing many
default values to be set so that they do not have to be mentioned on the
command line. Swimrc interacts directly with Perl allowing a wide variety
of variables found in <prgn>SWIW::Conf</prgn> to be altered. 

<chapt id="usage">USAGE

<p>
Values for variable can be altered for <STRONG>swim</STRONG> by assigning
different values enclosed in quotes or quoted whitespace (qw()), and ending
with a semi-colon. 
<P>

<tt> $variable = ``value'';</tt>
<p>
<tt>$variable = ``(value1 value2 ..)'';</tt>

<P>

<P>
<chapt id="variables">VARIABLES

<p>
This is a list of variables with explanations. The default values for
<STRONG>swim</STRONG> are shown.



<sect>OUTPUT VARIABLE 

<p>
<tt>$my_number</tt> can be changed to how many lines you would like
``swim -qf &lt;&gt;'' to print out, before the program asks for
<tt>-t</tt> or <tt>--total</tt>. Exception: If <tt>-i</tt> is
used in the query and there is more than one package then the total will
be presented.


<P>

Hint:  <tt>-t</tt> can be used with all the various
<tt>--scripts</tt> family members to view the title of the script file
regardless of this variable setting, and if <tt>-t</tt> has to be
used, the titles will be displayed, which makes sense.


<P>

<strong>$my_number = 23;</strong>


<sect>HISTORY

<p>

This is a shell-like history kept in relation to searches and the most
recent edit when <tt>--stdin</tt> is used.

<P>

<strong>$HISTORY = 10;</strong>


<sect>AR or DPKG?                                                  
      
<p>                                                                          
Debian packages are ar archives. If you are using a Debian Distribution         
assign ``dpkg'' to $package_tool, otherwise assign ``ar'' to                    
$package_tool.                                                                  
                                                                          
<p>                                                                                
<STRONG>$package_tool = "/usr/bin/ar";</STRONG>   

<sect>APT                                                          

<p>                                                                                
<STRONG>Swim</STRONG> does not assign a value for apt. To use                   
<tt>--apt</tt> and <tt>-xyz</tt> assign <tt>$apt</tt> the                       
value ``yes''.

<strong>less</strong> is a nice pager, unless you like
<strong>more</strong>! Pager is used for <tt>--help</tt> and
<STRONG>swim</STRONG> called without any options. There is an option
<tt>--nopager</tt> or <tt>-n</tt>. <strong>more</strong> comes from the
required package util-linux, whereas <strong>less</strong> comes from a
standard package called less.  Values: ``less'', ``more'', or ``most''
or... 
                                                                                
                                                                                
<P>

Assign values for <tt>$architecture</tt> and/or                                 
<tt>$distribution</tt> to avoid having to use <tt>--arch</tt> and

Architectures are always being added so check with Debian to find a list.       
There is <EM>alpha, arm, hurd-i386 (alternative kernel to linux), i386,

The distribution can be either <EM>stable, unstable, frozen, or
experimental (rare)</EM>. These represent the state of development that
the packages are under. The unstable distribution can have lot's of
changes within a very short time period, and frozen may or may not be
available.

Distributions are divided into sections. These sections were called             
distributions in the version 2.4.1.0 packaging manual, because they were
at     
one time separate distributions, but this has since changed.

You can determine which of the sections <EM>main, non-free, contrib or          
non-US</EM> to pull out of the Contents file if you don't want to use           
<tt>--main</tt>, <tt>--contrib</tt>, <tt>--non-free</tt>, and                   
<tt>--non-us</tt> to selectively pick the sections.

The default directory keeps track of Contents and/or Packages databases
retrieved with --ftp. The Contents and Packages databases and Release file
are give names specific to the distribution and architectures they
represent using the naming convention found in apt's sources directory. 
You also have the freedom not to use the default directory, in which case
swim

will still do the renaming and keeping track of the mtime, but you will         
have to remember where you put the files.

<P>                                                                             
                                                                                
The default root directory (DRD) is the key to easy management of binary        
packages, source, dsc, and diff files received from --ftp, and provides an      
easy way to put together a personalized distribution. This directory can
be     
a real ftp site on your computer, or put wherever else you are allowed to       
have directories. The DRD is always placed below the value assigned to          
$default_directory. According to the previous assignment to                     
$default_directory, if the DRD is ``/pub/a/debian'' then the full path          
would be ``/root/.swim/pub/a/debian''.   

<P>                                                                             
                                                                                
Example: When a package is downloaded it will be placed in                      
dists/distribution/section/architecture/subject below the DRD.                  
                                                                                
                                                                                
<P>                                                                             
                                                                                
Rule: debian must be the final directory before dists, this is because          
other distributions are placed alongside debian, like debian-non-US or          
personal (specialized distribution).                                            
                                                                                
                                                                                
<P>

<P>

<p>
If you want to set an alternative directory for the temporary files
created when the databases are made, change here. You may want to make
<tt>$tmp</tt> a RAM disk. See package loadlin for initrd documentation and
an explanation for making such a disk. There is also documentation in
/usr/src/kernel-source.version/Documentation. Whether this will speed
things up is a subject of experimentation.

<sect>FTP

<p>

You can alter the Firewall, Port, Timeout, Debug and Passive
characteristics of the ftp client as defined in Net::FTP(3pm) by providing
arguments to these variables. All variables but $timeout are set to untrue
by default. 
 
<example>
 $firewall = 0; (FTP firewall machine name)
 $port = 0;  (defaults to 23)   
 $timeout = 120;  (120 seconds)
 $debug = 0;  (1 will turn on STDERR)
 $passive = 0; (1 will enable)
</example>
