swim (0.3.6) -  October 20 2000

-- Made swim perl-5.6 happy.  Thanks to Douglas du Boulay 
   <ddb@crystal.uwa.edu.au> for pointing this out.

swim (0.3.5) - January 28 2000

-- Fixed a minor bug pertaining to the mtime of Contents which occured
   during initial building of the uninstalled filesystem using FDBDF or
   DF.  This bug arose as a result of a bug fix in 0.3.4.

swim (0.3.4) - January 23 2000

-- Made the changelog and copyright option work properly in relation to
   the fsstnd Debian has adopted with backwards compatibility.  Fixed a
   regexp in Qftp to properly deal with packages which match one another,
   but aren't the same.  Fixed xyzr to work properly with ps.  Fixed share
   -d/l output for p option.  Added an indication when extraction
   succeeds.  Now Contents is properly filtered for ndb. Removed extra
   output from menu for package option.  Added example documentation,
   thanks to John Lapeyre for the suggestion.  Also, thanks to Joel Soete
   for reporting corrupt sources from a faulty upload, and to tucows.com
   for adding swim to their archive and awarding swim 5 Penguins. 

swim (0.3.3) - January 15 2000

-- Repaired a bug in longswim causing the uninstalled filesystem to be
   made with packages which looked like spaces due to a return code error,
   which caused some trouble for the virtual directories.  ncontents is 
   now filtered of ./, though it was cool to look at.

swim (0.3.2) - January 05 2000

-- Fixed to properly find documentation in the not-installed new Debian 
   share directories, perl5 in Depends for the new Debian perl policy, and 
   year 2000 in help.   

swim (0.3.1) - January 04 2000                                                  
                                                                                
-- Because of change in Debian's directory structure in Contents, added a       
   filter so that not-installed database is properly made without repeats.      
   Fixed a documentation error in QUICKSTART.  Made swim@the.netpedia.net       
   default anonymous login.  Minor documentation improvements. 

swim (0.3.0) - June 15 1999

-- The cleaned up version of 0.2.9.  Rebuild databases if you were using
   version 0.2.8 or less.

swim (0.2.9) - May 14 1999

-- This is an interim release until 0.3.0 is released.  Major bug fixes,
   and some new features, including a history, and updating for
   not-installed db. Rebuild databases if you were using an older version. 

swim (0.2.8) - Mar 13 1999

-- Fixed a minor bug which was preventing virtual options --xyz and --ftp
   from working with searches.
-- Set the $swim_version variable to the right version number, and
   automated the release process to avoid problems like the failure to
   change this variable in the 0.2.7 release from occurring again.

swim (0.2.7) -  Mar 12 1999

-- Fixed a file test in SWIM::Conf which kept the initial directories from
   being created on startup, making the program fail.  Three names deserve
   recognition:  John Lapeyre, Jonathan P. Tomer, and Cale Epstein who all
   provided their own perspective to the problem, I combined all three
   approaches.  Shaleh pointed out a packaging error.

swim (0.2.6)

-- First initial public offering around the beginning of March, 1999,
   includes the main swim program, four exercise programs to help with
   database creation, important swim manuals and twenty-five module 
   members.
-- swimmers ... take your mark ... go!
