PREPARING YOUR INSTALLATION FOR APT

</h1>

<pre>usage: swim --audit
       swim --status
       swim -C</pre>
<P>

If you are using <strong>apt</strong> with <strong>swim</strong>, and this
is the first time you are using it with your installation, check your live
installation with this major mode. This is a call to <strong>dpkg -C
(--audit)</strong>, and will show any packages which are not properly
configured or installed. If you get any output, make corrections. The goal
is to get absolutely no output whatsoever because it is under these
conditions that apt will work properly. See the <A href="ch-query.html#s-vrrm">REMOVING AN INSTALLED PACKAGE - VIRTUAL OPTIONS 
, section 9.8</A> with 
<strong>-q</strong> to remove the offending packages. You may have to
remove the package by hand under unusual situations like when it is not
just dependencies (see <code>-T</code>) between packages keeping the package
from being removed perhaps due to a broken script (see
<code>--scripts</code>). In an extreme case you could manually remove the
entry for this package from the <em>/var/lib/dpkg/status</em> database,
and hunt down and remove all the files associated with the package with
<strong>swim's -l</strong> option. When you are done if you still want
some of the packages you removed, use <strong>apt</strong> to reinstall
them with <strong>swim's -xyz</strong> option. Also, <strong>apt</strong>
provides its own built-in method to clean up your system, and will provide
instructions, but you still may have to do some of the cleaning yourself
as discussed above.
