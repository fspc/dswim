UPGRADING WITH APT

</h1>

usage: <strong>swim --apt</strong>
<P>

options: <strong>[-xyz] [--upgrade] [--dist_upgrade]</strong>
<P>

<strong>apt-get</strong> provides powerful methods to change an
installion. When these methods are called using <strong>--apt</strong>,
<strong>swim</strong> will not allow you to proceed until you are
absolutely sure this is what you want to do. Before using these methods do
a ``<strong>swim --apt --update</strong>'' so that
<strong>apt-get</strong> knows the newest versions of available packages.
This major mode requires a combination of <strong>-x</strong>,
<strong>-xz</strong> or <strong>-xyz</strong> to be used along with either
<strong>--upgrade</strong> or <strong>--dist_upgrade</strong>. 
<strong>-x</strong> used alone will simulate what would happen if
<strong>-xz or -xyz</strong> were used (also see <code>-xyz</code> above).

<P>

<strong>--upgrade</strong> is somewhat similiar to doing ``<strong>swim
-qatxz</strong>'' except that it is a more intelligent method because
<strong>apt</strong> does some behind the scene calculations in regards to
package relationships, in fact the ``<strong>swim -qatxz</strong>''
approach will provide totally different results, or maybe these were the
results you really wanted. ``<strong>swim --apt --upgrade -xz</strong>''
is the prefered, proper, and built-in way provided by
<strong>apt-get</strong> to install the newest versions for all packages
installed on your system.  This method will not install any newer versions
of packages which would change the install status of other packages. Note:
It is not recommended to combine the query option <strong>-a</strong> with
<strong>-xz or -xyz</strong>, but combining the query option
<strong>-a</strong> just with <strong>-x</strong> can be educational. 

<P>

<strong>--dist_upgrade</strong> combines an <strong>--upgrade</strong>
with the installation of packages which are not installed. This method
carefully examines dependencies, and resolves conflicts, and given these
factors it will upgrade the most important packages before considering the
installation of less important packages. Less important packages will be
installed only if there are not any conflicts.
