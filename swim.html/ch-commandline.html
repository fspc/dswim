COMMAND LINE OPTION SYNTAX

</h1>
 When you press ``<strong>swim</strong>
&lt;<strong>enter</strong>&gt;`` you will see a listing of command line
options in a particular syntax.  This is to help you understand under what
context to use the options.  When you enter the options on the command
line, the brackets, parentheses, braces, diamonds, and question marks are
not actually used.
<P>
 

<strong>Major Mode Option</strong>
<P>

All command line options for <strong>swim</strong> always start with a
<strong>major mode option</strong>, except for ``swim &lt;enter&gt;``
which will show the whole listing of options. A major mode option is
surrounded in braces <strong>{ major mode option }</strong>. In the case
of {--search} there are the alternative major mode options
{--refinesearch} and {--research}, but because --search needs to be used
first before either of these two options, --refinesearch and --research
are surrounded in parentheses (). 
<P>

Note: Through the other chapters of this manual <strong>{}</strong> is
assumed for the <strong>major modes</strong> in the
<strong>usage:</strong> section shown at the beginning of every chapter. 
<P>

Let's take a closer look at this situation:

<P>

<code>{--search ? (--research || --refinesearch)&lt;pattern(s)&gt;}</code>
<P>
 `<strong>||</strong>' or `<strong>|</strong>' are used to indicate
`<strong>or</strong>', `<strong>?</strong>' indicates
`<strong>optional</strong>', &lt;diamond&gt; indicates an
<strong>argument</strong> (a required argument - see Arguments below),
(parenthesis) means `if used, must be used after the
previous required option was used'. Note: for readability
<code>--research</code> and -<code>-refinesearch</code> are not surrounded in
<code>{}</code>. 
<P>

<strong>Normal Options</strong>
<P>

Options to the major mode options are enclosed in brackets <strong>[
option to major mode ]</strong>.  <code>swim [-n]</code>
&lt;<code>enter</code>&gt; (assume enter from here on out), for instance,
will show all the command line options without using the pager. The pager
which swim uses can be set in <em>swimrc</em> (see <em>swimrc(8)</em>).
``<code>swim {--help} [-n]</code>'' will provide brief explanations of all of
swim's options without using the pager. In this case the major mode option
<strong>{--help}</strong>, and the option <strong>[-n]</strong> were used.
<P>

<strong>Dashes</strong>
<P>

Options which have a single dash can be combined with other single dashed
options <strong>(-qaint)</strong>. Double dashed options need to be
entered by themselves <strong>(--help --nopager)</strong>, many double
dashed options have an alternative single dash option <strong>(-n for
--nopager)</strong>.  The meaning of options is related to the major
mode they are being used with. <strong>[-n]</strong> means no pager
when called with <strong>{--help}</strong>, but it's a reference to the
not-installed databases when used with <strong>{-q --query}</strong>,
fortunately most options do not have double meanings.
<P>

<strong>Arguments</strong>
<P>

Many options require an argument. Arguments are enclose in diamonds &lt; 
<strong>argument</strong> &gt;. An argument to an option may also be
optional in which case a question mark ``<strong>?</strong>'' will be
placed between the option and the argument.  <strong>[-l ? 
&lt;[--df]&gt;]</strong> illustrates such a situation.
<strong>[-l]</strong> shows a file listings, and optionally the option
<strong>[--df]</strong> can be use with <strong>[-l]</strong> to show an
expanded listing. 
<P>

<strong>[--dbpath</strong> &lt;<strong>dir&gt;]</strong> requires an
argument, this time the argument would not be another option, but rather
it is a directory. 
<P>

Rule: When an option is an argument to another option it can be written
anywhere, but when a non-option is an argument
&lt;<strong>dir</strong>&gt; <strong>(notice no brackets)</strong> it has
to be placed directly after the option.  Sometimes, there may be
alternative arguments divided with ``<strong>|</strong>''. 
&lt;<strong>argument1|argument2</strong>&gt;  means use argument1 or
argument2, but not both.
<P>

Based on what we now know, let's compare this situation to the
<strong>{--search}</strong> situation shown above: 
<P>

<code>[--ftp ? --source | --source_only ? &lt;[--diff]&gt;]</code>
<P>
  

In this case <strong>--source</strong> or alternatively
<strong>--source_only</strong> can be optionally used along with
<strong>--ftp</strong> because they aren't in parentheses
<strong>()</strong> (also notice: | was used instead of ||, but means the
same thing ``or'').  <strong>--diff</strong> can optionally be provided as
an argument to either <strong>--source</strong> or
<strong>--source_only</strong>. For readability --source and --source_only
weren't enclosed in brackets.
<P>

<strong>Global Arguments</strong>
<P>

A <strong>global argument</strong> can be typed anywhere on the command
line, and can be an option or text. If global arguments
exist they are placed last after the list of normal
options that can be used with a major mode
option. 
<P>

[targets | -S] and [targets|APT|DF] are
examples.  {-q}, {--initndb}, and
{--rebuildndb} all use global arguments.  
<P>

<strong>Minor Mode Options</strong>
<P>

{-q --query} will generally use zero or more
minor mode options [-afpgn --dir], with
one exception (see <A href="ch-query.html">QUERYING THE INSTALLED AND NOT-INSTALLED DATABASES
, chapter 9</A>).
