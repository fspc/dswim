Description: Debian System Wide Information Manager
 DSWIM is a powerful package information and distribution research tool
 for both an installed Debian distribution or not-installed virtual
 Debian distribution(s) allowing querying of software packages with a
 variety of package information options, and powerful searches. Virtual
 options which include filesystem, installation, and package removal 
 capabilities can be seamlessly combined with querying or searches. 
 DSWIM can be used on computer systems which either have, or do not have 
 a Debian distribution installed.
 .
 Presently, the virtual -n options are not working with the new Debian archive
 hierarchy, so help information doesn't reflect them anymore.  Older versions
 of swim do support the previous archive hierarchy.  In the future, all -n 
 options may be handled directly through apt-cache information and apt cache 
 management rather than through huge databases.  The virtual filesystem will 
 still be managed by a database, and Contents.gz listings will also be 
 reinstated.
