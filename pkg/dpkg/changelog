dswim (0.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Dswim now creates databases for non-root users.  All db are now created in
    $HOME/default_directory/var/lib/dpkg rather than /var/lib/dpkg, and 
    .swim_history is put here, too.

  * Separated the documentation into a separate package, but keep man pages 
    around for backwards and current compatibility, and wrote a warning at top.

  * Removed lots of the -n db options from help because they are broken in 
    relation to major changes in the Debian archive.  Left some just as 
    reminders of dswims inherent ability for older Debian archives.

  * Updated copylet and swim is now DSWIM .. Debian System Wide Information 
    Manager.  Changed "Package administration and research tool for Debian" to 
    DSWIM.

  * Changed --nz to --no-download and now works properly with simulate.

  * --rebuilddb automatically when noticing a change near the beginning of 
    command() after --db --check runs  Added $no_rebuilddb configuration option 
    to allow users to override this behavior.

  * --remove and --purge are now handled by apt-get and apt's new --reinstall 
    added.

  * --source (-b, --diff-only, --tar-only) and --build-deb are new options to
    replace the old --ftp options because all this stuff is now handled by
    apt-get.

  * Added --config and --templates to the query options.

  * --initdb and --rebuilddb STDOUT output are now STDERR mostly to make debconf
    happy, and both of these options return their corresponding names via their
    functions.

  * Fixed many of the defined bugs and a few of the regexp bugs ..
    these were just the complaints of the newer Perl.

  * Fixed undef values when scripts() was called more than once when used with
    -qf, --scripts, -d|-l and -T.

  * Added swim_pkg to CVS to simplify packaging dswim.

  * The control dependencies have been improved.

swim (0.3.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

    during initial building of the uninstalled filesystem using FDBDF or

swim (0.3.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Made the changelog and copyright option work properly in relation to
    the fsstnd Debian has adopted with backwards compatibility.  Fixed a
    regexp in Qftp to properly deal with packages which match one another,
    but aren't the same.  Fixed xyzr to work properly with ps.  Fixed share
    -d/l output for p option.  Added an indication when extraction
    succeeds.  Now Contents is properly filtered for ndb. Removed extra
    output from menu for package option.  Added example documentation,
    thanks to John Lapeyre for the suggestion.  Also, thanks to Joel Soete
    for reporting corrupt sources from a faulty upload, and to tucows.com
    for adding swim to their archive and awarding swim 5 Penguins.

swim (0.3.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Repaired a bug in longswim causing the uninstalled filesystem to be
    made with packages which looked like spaces due to a return code error,
    which caused some trouble for the virtual directories.  ncontents is
    now filtered of ./, though it was cool to look at.

swim (0.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    default anonymous login.  Minor documentation improvements.
