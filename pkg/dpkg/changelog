swim (0.3.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a minor bug pertaining to the mtime of Contents which occured
    during initial building of the uninstalled filesystem using FDBDF or

swim (0.3.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Made the changelog and copyright option work properly in relation to
    the fsstnd Debian has adopted with backwards compatibility.  Fixed a
    regexp in Qftp to properly deal with packages which match one another,
    but aren't the same.  Fixed xyzr to work properly with ps.  Fixed share
    -d/l output for p option.  Added an indication when extraction
    succeeds.  Now Contents is properly filtered for ndb. Removed extra
    output from menu for package option.  Added example documentation,
    thanks to John Lapeyre for the suggestion.  Also, thanks to Joel Soete
    for reporting corrupt sources from a faulty upload, and to tucows.com
    for adding swim to their archive and awarding swim 5 Penguins.

swim (0.3.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Repaired a bug in longswim causing the uninstalled filesystem to be
    made with packages which looked like spaces due to a return code error,
    which caused some trouble for the virtual directories.  ncontents is
    now filtered of ./, though it was cool to look at.

    default anonymous login.  Minor documentation improvements.
