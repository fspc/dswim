<h1 align=center>QUICKSTART</h1>

<br><br>

<h5>READ THE <A HREF="REQUIREMENTS.html">REQUIREMENTS</A></h5>

Now you can skip the next three steps if you have an installed Debian
distribution and you are in a hurry for a demonstration, but you will miss
out on swim's more awesome capabilities. With that said..... 

<p>
<b>FIRST GET SWIMRC PREPARED</b>

<p> Edit the swimrc configution file, you should read <A
HREF="swimrc.html/index.html">swimrc(5)</A>, but I'll ask you some
question right now.  You can find swimrc in /etc/swim, and swimrc can be
placed in your home directory in the subdirectory .swim. Entries in the
home directory swimrc override ones in /etc/swim. 

<p>
Are you using an installed Debian system?  If so, you almost definitely
have dpkg installed.  So uncomment this line in /etc/swim/swimrc by
removing the pound sign. 

<p>
<code>$package_tool = "/usr/bin/dpkg";</code>

<p>otherwise

<p>
<code>$package_tool = "/usr/bin/ar";</code>

<p>
Do you have the apt package installed?  Configure this, or -xyz will not
work.

<p>
<code>$apt = "yes";</code>

<p>
Now you need to decide what architecture you would like to be swim's
default value when you download, build, and query the not-installed
databases.

<p>
What flavor, do you want alpha, arm, hurd-i386, i386, m68k, powerpc,
or sparc? (more coming :*)  I decided on .....

<p>
<code>$architecture = "i386";</code>

<p>
What kind of distribution do you want to be your default? stable,
unstable, frozen, or experimental (rare)  I like the ever changing ...

<p>
<code>$distribution = "unstable";</code>

<p>
Decide which sections you want?  You can have this

<p>
<code>@user_defined_section = qw(main contrib non-free);</code>

<p>
or this.

<p>
<code>@user_defined_section = qw(main);</code>

<p>
or .....
   
<p>
<b>SECOND GET SWIMZ.LIST PREPARED</b>

<p> Now grab a copy of the <A
HREF="http://www.debian.org/misc/README.mirrors">README.mirrors</A> from
http://www.debian.org/misc/README.mirrors", 
you will need this to set-up the configuration file /etc/swim/swimz.list. 

<p> If your using apt make sure to read <A
HREF="swim.html/index.html">swim(8)</A> to get the nitty gritty on how you
can synchronize swim along with apt :*} using <A
HREF="swim.html/ch-important.html#s5.6">swimz.list</A>. 

<p>
Humm, you found a site which has the distribution you want, and you know
which section you want, and you are happy knowing about packages which can
install on the architecture you computer happens to have.

<p>
So what site is that?

<p>
<code>deb ftp://ftp.swimz.org</code>

<p>
What was the directory you happened to notice in the README.mirrors page?  

<p>
<code>deb ftp://ftp.swimz.org/pub/debian</code>

<p>
What distribution did you want?  Note: You won't want to use the Release
code name for the distribution, see
<A HREF="swim.html/ch-important.html#s5.6">swimz.list</A>.

<p>
<code>deb ftp://ftp.swimz.org/pub/debian unstable</code>

<p>
What sections did you want?

<p>
<code>deb ftp://ftp.swimz.org/pub/debian unstable main contrib
non-free</code>

<p>
Now put this line in the swimz.list, exactly like written, and ofcourse
use the values you want. 

<p>
<b>THIRD GET THE DEBIAN DATABASE WITH FTP</b>

<p>
Just issue this command.

<p>
<kbd>swim --ftp --Contents DF --Packages DF</kbd>

<p>
and wait a little bit.

<p>
<b>FOURTH BUILD THE DATABASES</b>

<p>
This is for a computer system with a Debian distribution installed.

<p>
<kbd>swim --initdb</kbd>

<p>
This next part applies to people who followed all the steps to get here,
and also read the important requirements at the top.  This makes the
not-installed databases.  Go take a walk, or a swim :*}

<p>
<kbd>swim --initndb --Contents DF DF</kbd>

<p>
When either of these commands are complete they will say "<samp>over and
out</samp>".

<p>
<b>NOW WHAT?</b>

<p> Now the real fun begins.  If you happen to have some experience with
rpm you already know some of the options which swim uses, but be prepared
for surpises.  <A HREF="swim.html/index.html">swim(8)</A> goes into more detail, the
<A HREF="http://www.rpm.org/maximum-rpm.ps.gz">"<cite>Maximum
RPM</cite>"</A> book by Edward C. Bailey which is freely available may
provide help for swim's <kbd>--query</kbd> option, but you will find that
swim greatly diverges from rpm. 

<p> Try something like this, and do not use the <kbd>-n</kbd> unless you
made the not-installed databases, on the other hand, <em>REMEMBER</em> to
use <kbd>-n</kbd> if you do not have an installed Debian system.... 

<p>
<kbd>swim -n --search swim</kbd>

<p>
now do this..

<p>
<kbd>swim -qnSi</kbd> or <kbd>swim -hn</kbd>

<p>
go to the directory /usr/bin and do

<p>
<kbd>swim -qnf</kbd> <b>.</b>

<p>
you probably will have to do

<p>
<kbd>swim -qnft</kbd> <b>.</b>

<p>
<b>...the fun is just beginning...</b>

<p>
<em>Where are you swimming to today?</em>
