* Permissions of some directories are weird using mkdir().
* ftp()/qftp() doesn't handle timeout problems very well, if alarm()
  and SIG{ALRM} are used program quits with stdout "Alarm Bell".
* Debian md5sum program has different output than non-Debian md5sum
  programs, will probably switch to MD5 module.
* --ftp, swimz.list, for non-US using the dists/arch/ notation doesn't 
  work on all sites, normal notation works if the site is set-up
  this way.
