<h2>REQUIRMENTS:</h2>  

<p>
Don't get intimidated, this is just to cover all bases, most computer
systems meet the requirements.<p>

<b>PERL</b>:  Yes, preferably Perl 5.004.04 or greater.

<p> <b>FTP CAPABILITIES (optional)</b>: You may need to get <A
HREF="ftp://www.perl.com/pub/perl/CPAN/modules/by-category/05_Networking_Devices_IPC/Net/libnet-1.0606.tar.gz">Net::FTP</A>
(Debian libnet-perl package) which depends on Data::Dumper (Debian
data-dumper package).  You also need <b>gcc</b> if you do not have a
Debian system so that <em>swim</em> can figure out what architecture your
machine is. You can also find these modules at the <A
HREF="http://www.perl.com">CPAN mirrors</A> or the PACKAGES below.

<p> <b>READLINE CAPABILITIES (optional)</b>:  For nice readline
cpabilities get <A
HREF="ftp://www.perl.com/pub/perl/CPAN/modules/by-module/Term/Term-ReadLine-Gnu-1.03.tar.gz">Term::ReadLine::Gnu</A>
or alternatively <A
HREF="ftp://www.perl.com/pub/perl/CPAN/modules/by-module/Term/Term-ReadLine-Perl-0.990
6.tar.gz">Term::ReadLine::Perl</A> which depends on <A
HREF="ftp://www.perl.com/pub/perl/CPAN/modules/by-module/Term/TermReadKey-2.12.tar.gz">Term::ReadKey</A>
. <em>Term::ReadLine::Gnu</em> may be tricky to set-up on non Debian
systems because it depends on <em>ncurses3.4</em> and the <em>GNU Readline
Library version 2.1 or later</em>, but <em>Term::ReadLine::Perl</em> is
much easier to set-up and allows a huge amount of package names to be
present on the command line without a segmentation fault. You could get
swim's ftp capabilities working first, and then just fetch the Debian
ReadLine package(s) and then use swim's --extract option to set the
package(s) up, but, it is sure fun doing a 'make test' when setting up the
ReadLine modules! You can also find these modules at the <A
HREF="http://www.perl.com">CPAN mirrors</A> or the PACKAGES below. <p>

<b>DATABASE CAPABILITIES</b>:  DB_File comes standard with Perl. But,
this doesn't mean it is compiled for the newer Berkeley Database
Libraries. DB 1.85 has
known  <A
HREF="http://www.sleepycat.com/historic.html"> 
bugs</A> which effect SWIM. SWIM can work with
1.85, but <kbd>--rebuildflatdb</kbd> and <kbd>--rebuildflatndb</kbd> will
not work properly. You can run a test to find out whether or not you need
to make the change if you have db_dump available on your system (which
db_dump). Enter this: 

<P>
<code>perl -e 'use DB_File; tie %testdb,'DB_File',"testdb";';<br>
db_dump testdb</code>

<P>If 'db_dump testdb' produces an error you need to make the change by
installing the newest DB_File.  If you have a version of libc6 less than 
2.1, first, install a new version ( 2.3.4  or greater) of the <A
HREF="http://www.sleepycat.com">Berkeley DB</A> if you don't already
have it installed.   If you get
<A
HREF="ftp://www.perl.com/pub/perl/CPAN/modules/by-module/DB_File/DB_File-1.65.tar.gz"> 
 DB_File</A>
from CPAN you will need to edit  
config.in to point to the location of where libdb2 installed db.h, where 
libdb2 is installed on your system, and the name of the library.  For
Debian this would be:

<P><code>INCLUDE = /usr/include/db2<br>
LIB = /usr/lib<br>
DBNAME = -ldb2</code>

<p><b>PACKAGES</b>: You can get the CPAN modules in some package formats. 
Debian 2.1 and Red Hat 5.0 have been tested with these packages:

<p>
<b>USER</b>: root.  Some of swim's most important functions will not work
properly unless you are running the program as root. 

<p><b>HARD DRIVE SPACE</b>: Make sure you have enough hard drive space.
1500
installed packages produces a 10MB fileindex.deb, and the virtual
not-installed filesystem database for the unstable distribution is now
over 40MB.  100MB of free space on your hard drive is probably a good
safety margin, if you run out of hard drive space the program will just
hang or quit.

<p>

<b>MEMORY</b>: Databases made for an installed Debian system require
memory in proportion to the amount of packages actually installed; the
<kbd>--lowmem</kbd> option is an excellent alternative for making the
databases if the computer system is either overloaded or low on memory. 
If you get "out of memory" warnings try to free up some memory first then
make the databases.  You can also avoid making the virtual filesystem by
not using the <kbd>--Contents</kbd> option or using the FDB argument for
that option.  Updating the databases uses very little memory. 

<p> <b>OTHER SWIM FUNCTIONS</b>:  Most free operating systems have these
packages installed:  On a non Debian system, <b>ar</b> from
<em>binutils</em> is used to query Debian binary packages. These next
packages are essential in a free operating system (Linux) -
<em>textutils</em>, <em>fileutils</em>, <em>grep</em>, <em>tar</em>,
<em>gzip</em>, and <em>mount</em>.
